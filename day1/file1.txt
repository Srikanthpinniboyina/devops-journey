Perfect! 🚀 Welcome to Day 1 of your DevOps journey, starting July 12, 2025. Here's exactly what you should do today:

✅ Day 1 Goals
Set up your environment


Get comfortable with the Linux terminal


Learn basic file and directory commands


Document what you learn in a GitHub repo or personal notes



🖥 Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
Choose one of the following:
🔹 If on Windows:
Install WSL2 + Ubuntu


🔹 If on Mac:
Use built-in Terminal (already Unix-based)


🔹 If you prefer Virtual Machine:
Install VirtualBox + Ubuntu ISO
 Download Ubuntu


🔹 Optional: Try AWS Free Tier
Create an EC2 instance using Ubuntu



💻 Step 2: Practice Basic Linux Commands
Open the terminal and practice:
pwd            # Show current directory
ls             # List directory contents
ls -la         # Show hidden files + details
cd             # Change directory
mkdir test     # Create a directory
touch file.txt # Create an empty file
nano file.txt  # Edit file (or use vim if you know it)
rm file.txt    # Delete file

📝 Task: Create a directory called day1, navigate into it, and create 2 text files.

⚙️ Step 3: Install Basic DevOps Tools
On Ubuntu:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git curl wget net-tools tree htop -y


🗂️ Step 4: Create a GitHub Repo (optional but encouraged)
Go to GitHub


Create a new repository: devops-journey


On your terminal:


git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/devops-journey.git
cd devops-journey
mkdir day1

Add your notes/scripts inside day1/


Push to GitHub:


git add .
git commit -m "Day 1: Linux basics and setup"
git push origin main


🎯 End of Day 1 Checklist
✅ Linux/WSL/Ubuntu VM installed


✅ Terminal running and tested basic commands


✅ Installed essential packages (git, curl, htop, etc.)


✅ Created and navigated folders via CLI


✅ Created GitHub repo for your journey (or documented locally)



Would you like me to give you a short daily routine and checklist for the next 6 days of Week 1?
